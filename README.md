# Cadillac Lounge 

## Jazz & Blues Bar
I received the inspiration to this project when I was skimming the web for images to another project.

The Cadillac Lounge is an ficticious Jazz & Blues Bar in central Chicago.
Setting the Cadillac Lounge apart from other bars in Chicago, is the quality service and know-how 
provided from the staff, as well as arranged weekly jam session, where the guests can participate with 
their instruments and jam with the house band. Live music sessions from well known and established jazz 
and blues musicians takes place every weekend.

As bar owner, I want to provide an outstanding service to my guests, with the aim to gain high customer 
retention and renom√©. My marketing channels will be through the traditional channels (magazines and web 
sites as Tripadvisor), but foremost, through the web site to attract new customers, unfamiliar with the bar 
or the off-chance visitor skimming the web.

## UX
---------
The typical visitor to the Cadillac Lounge web page is, firstly, an odd chance visitor skimming the web for 
an evening venue, a returning visitor seeking information regarding events, opening hours and contact information. 
Lastly, a muscician seeking the opportunity to be engaged for a music session.

The demographics for jazz and blues listeners is widely spread (study by Jazz Audiences Initiative, US 2015 ). 
[To the study ](https://bluesjazzlondon.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/the-demographics-of-blues-and-jazz-listeners-in-6-graphs/)

In short, the average jazz and blues listeners are:
* working full time
* have a Bachelors Degree
* are married or partnered
* aged 45-54

They listen to the genre occasionally. The challenges as a bar owner is to target customers from such a widely spread 
demographics.

### User story
-------------
* New customer

I am a potential customer, skimming the web for a venue to have a night out with friends and family. 
When I am skimming the pages my attention is drawn to the unexpected and out of the ordinary. The clean landing site 
of the bar with an inviting image of the exterior will differ from other pages.
I will need to know more about the bar, I therefor click on the navbar or scroll to the second 'About' page.
 I need contact information to know where to go, opening hours and how to get in touch for specific 
information. I then click again on the navbar, or click on the link provided in the text, or 
scroll further down the pages to the contact information provided in the footer.

* Returning customer

 I am a frequent visitor to Cadillac Lounge. I want to keep myself updated of the upcoming events for
 the week or later that month. I am mostly interested in the event section and further information 
 about the bands and to book a ticket. I use the navbar to navigate on the page to the event section. 
 From there I can use the provided link in the text to Spotify for more information, or go directly to an external booking 
 site, by clicking on the "Tickets" button to place a booking for the event.

 * Business related customer

 I am a muscician seeking the opportunity to be engaged for an event. My main focus when visiting the 
 web page is how to get in contact with the bar and an address. The information I am seeking is in the practical 
 area (performance gear, booking schedule and so on). I navigate the web page by using the navbar and go to
 the contact page. I fill out the form or look in the footer, directly below, for additional contact information.

 ### Design
 The color scheme is based on the landing site image. The structural design and typography is chosen to give a modern,
 clean, yet a sense of the 1950's era, which is also demonstrated in the logo typography.

## Features
--------------
I want to present a clean and easy to navigate, mobile first web site, which scrolls up and down to keep the mobile user 
experience in all screen sizes. My aim is that the user shall find what they seek within three actions (click on a button, link..).


### Existing Features
**Home** **page** have a fixed to top navbar with links to all pages for easy access to the whole web site. The links have a hover effect 
as an interaction feedback to the user. The navigation dropdown menu is not self closing on smaller devices, and is a future improvement for me to make.
The center positioned jumbotron have a short but clear message of web site content.

**About** **us** page is divided into three headlines (the bar, jam session and events) to present what activities to expect. To ease the decision process
 and to promote an action to take the next step, two links is provided in the text - contact and event.

 **Event** **page** is a textual as well as an imagery presentation of the  up coming music sessions. A button with a link to an 
 external ticket agency is provided. Additional information about the artist and their music is supplied by a link to Spotify. 

 **Contact** **us** section consists of a contact form with a footer below, containing the contact information and social links.
 If the input fields is not correctly filled out a notification will inform the user and let the user know which fields is 
 required to be able to submit.

### Future implements
Future implementations to event section would be an image gallery of the artist/artists when mouse-over the image and a clickable music sample.
Futher I would like to expand the web site with a photo gallery page and increase user interaction with the possibility to give 
feed back  and ratings of the bar and events as a slide show or carousel.
