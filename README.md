# Cadillac Lounge 

Follow this link to a live [version](https://helena-p.github.io/milestone_project_1/).

## Jazz & Blues Bar
I received the inspiration to this project when I was skimming the web for images to another project.

The Cadillac Lounge is an ficticious Jazz & Blues Bar in central Chicago.
Setting the Cadillac Lounge apart from other bars in Chicago, is the quality service and know-how 
provided from the staff, as well as arranged weekly jam session, where the guests can participate with 
their instruments and jam with the house band. Live music sessions from well known and established jazz 
and blues musicians takes place every weekend.

As bar owner, I want to provide an outstanding service to my guests, with the aim to gain high customer 
retention and renom√©. My marketing channels will be through the traditional channels (magazines and web 
sites as Tripadvisor), but foremost, through the web site to attract new customers, unfamiliar with the bar 
or the off-chance visitor skimming the web.

## UX
---------
The typical visitor to the Cadillac Lounge web page would be:
* an odd chance visitor skimming the web for an evening venue
* a returning customer seeking information regarding events, opening hours and contact information. 

The demographics for jazz and blues listeners is widely spread (study by Jazz Audiences Initiative, US 2015 ). 
[To the study ](https://bluesjazzlondon.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/the-demographics-of-blues-and-jazz-listeners-in-6-graphs/)

In short, the average jazz and blues listeners are:
* working full time
* have a Bachelors Degree
* are married or partnered
* aged 45-54

They listen to the genre occasionally. The challenges as a bar owner is to target customers from such a widely spread 
demographics.

### User story
-------------
**New customer goal**
1. I want to know what the bar can offer and how they can meet my expectations.
2. I need to know of the events and happenings and what I need to do to participate.
1. I would need to know the address , the opening hours, and how to get in touch.

**Frequent visitor goal**
1. I want regular updates of the events.
2. I need to buy tickets.

 ### Design
 1. The color scheme is based on the landing site image. 
 2. Poppins typography is chosen to give a sense of the 1950's era and the old Cadillac on the building, and yet modern. The logo typography, Yellowtail, is matched to the neon sign in the landing site image.
 3. Imagery is important to build a positive first impression. On first sight a clean landing site image, but the image contains several details that give the viewer a sense of
 what to expect, such as live bands, opening hours and back yard patio.

## Features
--------------
I want to present a clean and easy to navigate, mobile first responsive web site, which scrolls up and down to keep the mobile user 
experience in all screen sizes. My aim is that the user shall find what they seek within three actions.


### Existing Features
1. **Home page**
    * Fixed to top navbar with links for easy access to the whole web site. The links have a hover effect as an interaction feedback to the user. 
    * The landing site jumbotron have a short but clear message of web site content.

1. **About us**
    * The text is divided into three headlines for clarity - the bar, Wednesday jam sessions and events.
    * To promote an action to take the next step, two links is provided in the text - contact and event.

 3. **Event page**
    * Textual as well as an imagery presentation of the  up coming music sessions. 
    * A button with a link to an external ticket agency is provided. 
    * Additional information about the artist and their music is supplied by a link to Spotify. 

 4. **Contact**
    * Consists of a contact form with a footer below, containing the contact information and social links.
    * If the input fields is not correctly filled out a notification will inform the user and let the user know which fields is required to be able to submit.
 

### Future implements
Future implementations I would liketo add is an image gallery of the artist/artists when mouse-over the image, and an on-click music sample.
Further I would like to expand the web site with a photo gallery and increase user interaction with the possibility to give 
feed back  and ratings of the bar/events in the form of a slide show or carousel.

### Content
Content is written by myself, with the exception of the text about the musicians in the 'Event' page, which 
 is copied and translated from the Fasching web site. The idea of the bar being a sponsor to a 
festival came from The Spotted Cat Music Club.
### Media
Numerous images is supplied from free image providers such as Pexels, Burst and Pixabay, but I also purchased
 several images from Shutterstock.
### Acknowledgements
* The submit button is active, but will direct to an external page with 'Error Respons'. According to Code Institute this is 
 within acceptance for a Milestone Project 1, since the students have not studied the programming language required for this function to work.
* There is white space in the small mobile devices (280px) on the right side.
* The textarea and images in the event page is not properly aligned at some points at certain screen widths.
* I want to credit the help and assistance of Daniel Svensson (family member) with a bug issue in landing site jumbotron due to Autoprefixer extension
in combination with 'display:flex'.
* Research made for this Milestone Project consists of visiting similar businesses web pages, reading in on demographics of customer and customer path to purchase.
* Oluwafemi Medale mentor
* Family members for being there and testing the project on numerous ways and platforms.
* Last, but not the least - my partner in life for being so supportive and understanding.
